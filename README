OPTIONS
    -f *file* | -o *file*
        Write tags til specified file. Value of `-' writes tags to stdout.
        Default is `tags'

    -a  Append the tags to an existing tag file

    -h, --help
        Print a summary of options and exit.

    --version
        Print version information on standard output then exit successfully.

EXAMPLES
    To create tags from the file `test.rpgle', you'd use

        rpglectags test.rpgle

    To create tags from all rpgle and sqlrpgle files recursively, you might
    say

        find . -type f \( -name '*.rpgle' -o -name '*.sqlrpgle' \) \
          -exec rpglectags {} +

    More examples:

        rpglectags -f - test2.rpgle        # Print tags to stdout
        rpglectags -a test2.rpgle          # Append tags to the 'tags' file

TAG FILE FORMAT
    Each entry in the tag file consists of a separate line, each looking
    like this in the most general case:

        {tagname}<TAB>{tagfile}<TAB>{tagaddress};"<TAB>{tagfields}

    The fields and separators of these lines are specified as follows:

    1.  Tag name

    2.  Single tab character

    3.  Name of the file in which the object associated with the tag is
        located

    4.  Single tab character

    5.  Tag address. A non magic pattern enclosed in / or ? or a line
        number.

    6.  A constant `;"' for backward compatibility with vi(1)

    7.  Extra fields narrowing down the type of tag entry, i.e. kind:{fvms},
        struct:nameOfStruct

EXIT STATUS
    The following exit values shall be returned:

    0   Successful completion.

    1   Error parsing command-line argument.
